# animal-love-wall
A personal project to store and remember meaningful animal encounters.

# 🐾 Animal Love Wall

Animal Love Wall is a simple web application I built to apply and understand the fundamentals of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to register, log in, and maintain a personal wall of animal memories.

This project focuses on learning by building, rather than just theory.

## What I Used & Learned
- **HTML**: Page structure, forms, and navigation
- **CSS**: Layout, styling, hover effects, and consistent UI
- **JavaScript**:
  - DOM manipulation and event handling
  - Working with arrays and objects
  - User authentication logic (frontend-only)
  - Storing and retrieving data using `localStorage`
  - Rendering and deleting dynamic content

---

## How It Works
- Users register and log in
- Each user has their own private set of memories
- Memories can be added and deleted
- Data persists across page refresh using `localStorage`
- Logout ends the session

## Note
This is a frontend-only, educational project.  
It does not use backend authentication and is not meant for production use.

This project represents my current learning stage and how I connect concepts into a working application.
